"""Detect workflow presets whose edge filters no longer match the loaded data.

Presets pin edge predicates as bare strings in ``edgeFilters.Label``. When the
ETL renames a predicate, the filter stops matching and the preset returns fewer
results with no error — the failure this module exists to make visible.

Every read here fails open. A guard that flags all 24 presets because ArangoDB
hiccuped is worse than no guard, so an unreadable dataset yields ``None``
("cannot determine") rather than an empty set ("nothing exists").
