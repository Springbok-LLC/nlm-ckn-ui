    Constructs and executes a graph traversal AQL query.

    Args:
        node_ids (list): A list of starting node _id strings.
        depth (int): The maximum depth for the graph traversal.
        edge_direction (str): 'INBOUND', 'OUTBOUND', or 'ANY'.
        allowed_collections (list): A list of vertex collection names to include.
        graph (str): The graph type ("ontologies" or "phenotypes").
        edge_filters (dict): A dictionary for filtering edges.
        terminal_collections (list): Optional list of vertex collection names
            that are visited and returned but never expanded through. Uses
            PRUNE, which emits the matched vertex and stops descent past it.
            PRUNE is also evaluated at depth 0, where v is the traversal start
            vertex and e is null — even when the traversal range starts at 1 —
            and pruning there stops the traversal before it emits anything. The
            emitted condition is therefore guarded with `e != null`, which is
            what exempts the origin: an origin whose own collection is terminal
            still expands normally. Cannot be combined with
            exclude_closing_edges or require_closing_edges.
        include_inter_node_edges (bool): If True, includes edges between nodes
            in the result set. Ignored when exclude_closing_edges is active
            (the path-aware branch returns complete path links directly).
        exclude_closing_edges (dict): Optional path-aware anti-edge (NAC) filter,
            shape {"Label": [...]}. When set, only full-depth paths are kept whose
            endpoint has NO edge of the given label(s) back to that path's own
            origin (start node). Used to find "open" motifs, e.g. drug paths that
            do not close back to the disease via IS_SUBSTANCE_THAT_TREATS.
        require_closing_edges (dict): Positive complement of
            exclude_closing_edges, same shape {"Label": [...]}. When set, only
            full-depth paths are kept whose endpoint DOES have an edge of the
            given label(s) back to that path's own origin. Used to find "closed"
            motifs, e.g. complete drug-repurposing dippers where the drug treats
            the disease. Supplying both raises ValueError (they cannot compose).
