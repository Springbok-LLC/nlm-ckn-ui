/**
 * Searchability contract test.
 *
 * The ArangoSearch view (__fixtures__/indexed.json) defines, per collection, which
 * document attributes are indexed and therefore *matchable* by the backend
 * SEARCH clause. However, a field is only searched in practice if the frontend
 * includes it in the `search_fields` it sends to /arango_api/search/.
 *
 * That list comes from getAllSearchableFields(), which is derived from the
 * collection-maps config (individual_fields[].field_to_display) -- a SEPARATE
 * source from the view definition. If the two drift apart, a field can be
 * indexed in the view yet never actually searched (or vice-versa).
 *
 * This test asserts every field indexed by the view is covered by the frontend
 * searchable set, so "all view fields are searchable" stays true.
 *
 * NOTE: This is the real coverage gate. It does NOT involve LABEL_FIELDS in the
 * backend -- those only shape the RETURN projection, not what is searched.
 *
 * FIXTURE PROVENANCE: __fixtures__/indexed.json is a static snapshot of the
 * deployed ArangoSearch view, so it can drift from the live view. Search is
 * phenotypes-only, so regenerate it from Cell-KN-Phenotypes after any view
 * change by dumping the live definition, e.g.:
 *
 *   arangosh --server.database Cell-KN-Phenotypes \
 *     --javascript.execute-string \
 *     'print(JSON.stringify(db._view("indexed").properties(), null, 2))' \
 *     > react/src/utils/__fixtures__/indexed.json
 *
 * or fetch GET /_db/Cell-KN-Phenotypes/_api/view/indexed/properties (REST) and
 * format the result with Biome. A stale snapshot can hide real drift, so
 * refresh it whenever the view's indexed fields change.
