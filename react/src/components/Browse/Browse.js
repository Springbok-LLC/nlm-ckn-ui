/**
 * Browse: one page hosting the sunburst and tree views over the same CL
 * hierarchy data, so toggling between them is free -- no refetch, and the
 * view you switch to opens on the node you were just looking at.
 *
 * Owns four pieces of state -- `label`, `data`, `focusPath`, `expandedPaths`
 * -- plus loading/error. `focusPath` is a root-to-node id path rather than a
 * bare id because the hierarchy is a DAG: a node can appear at more than one
 * position, and only a path names a single occurrence.
 *
 * `expandedPaths` is its own state, not derived from `focusPath`: the tree
 * can hold many branches open at once (expanding sibling A then sibling B
 * keeps both open, exactly as standalone /tree always has), while the
 * sunburst can only center on one node at a time. Deriving `expandedPaths`
 * from `focusPath` on every render would collapse every branch outside the
 * current focus on each tree interaction, which is a regression, not the
 * intended hand-off. The hand-off -- and the only place a collapse is
 * intended -- is switching from the sunburst to the tree: `expandedPaths` is
 * reseeded to `focusPath`'s prefixes at that moment, so the tree opens on the
 * node the sunburst was centered on. The reverse hand-off (tree to sunburst)
 * updates `focusPath` to whichever path the tree last toggled, so switching
 * to the sunburst centers on wherever the user was just working; it does not
 * try to represent every open branch, only the last one touched.
