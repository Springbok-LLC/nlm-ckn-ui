/**
 * UI-local sidebar section structure, keyed by collection abbreviation.
 *
 * This is a presentation-only config owned by the UI. It is intentionally
 * separate from `assets/nlm-ckn-collection-maps.json`, which is kept
 * byte-identical with the ETL repo by a sync workflow and must not carry
 * UI section tags.
 *
 * Each field descriptor:
 *   - key:     the document property to read.
 *   - label:   the display label shown in the sidebar (authoritative).
 *   - variant: optional; "description" renders as a lead paragraph, not a row.
 *
 * Values and URLs for keys that also appear in the collection map are resolved
 * through `getDisplayFields` (so URL templates stay in one place). Keys not in
 * the collection map resolve their plain value straight from the document; if a
 * key is absent in the data, that field simply does not render.
