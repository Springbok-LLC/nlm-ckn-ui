# deploy-frontend.sh - Deploy Frontend Application
# ==============================================================================
# Builds the React frontend and deploys to S3/CloudFront.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./scripts/app/deploy-frontend.sh <environment>
#
# WHAT IT DOES:
#   1. Gets ALB DNS name from CloudFormation Stack
#   2. Syncs build files to S3 (leaving the plots/* asset prefix untouched)
#   3. Creates CloudFront invalidation
#   4. Shows application URLs
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#   - AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
#   - Node.js and npm installed
#   - Infrastructure deployed (nlm-ckn-iac: deploy/02-deploy-environment.sh)
#   - React application in ../react directory
#
#
# ROLLBACK:
#   S3 versioning is enabled. Use AWS Console to restore previous version.
#
# MONITORING:
#   Check invalidation status:
#     aws cloudfront get-invalidation \
#       --distribution-id <DIST_ID> \
#       --id <INVALIDATION_ID>
#
# NOTES:
#   CloudFront invalidation may take a few minutes to propagate globally.
#   Use hard refresh in browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) to bypass local cache.
